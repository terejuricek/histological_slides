# histological_slides
This Python script handles tables with information about histological slides and scans. It allows users to:
* Parse filenames of histological scan files to extract metadata such as patient ID, slide ID, section, slide number, and staining method.
* Update and create CSV files based on input text files.
* Convert between CSV and Excel file formats.
* Compare two CSV files to find and output the differences.
